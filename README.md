# Numerical-Analysis-Methods
Different numerical analysis methods using  C++


## Notes
* Bisection Method: The method is implemented using the function f(x) = exp(x)-2-x, with the tolerance value (delta) set to 5e-9 and the maximum number of iterations set to 50.
* False Position Method: The method is implemented using the function f(x) = exp(x)-2-x, with the tolerance value (delta) and epsilon set to 5e-9 and the maximum number of iterations set to 50.
* Power fit Method: Find the least-square power curve y = Bx^3, assuming that the number of points is equal to 5 and the degree of power fit is equal to 3.
